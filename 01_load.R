#From Tony - YES – it doesn’t matter whether 1 hunter hunted for 20 days or 20 hunters for 1 day, this is the perhaps the best link to Grizzly bear mortality risk, with one possible enhancement: the number of animals they drop also influences that risk, strongly it seems. Meat on the landscape, attracting bears, to places and circumstances near people with guns. It’s too late in the day to bring it to mind, but I’m pretty sure there is research support.

#A mixed index of risk of DAYS and KILLS, combined somehow? Two indices of risk, one that compounds and worsens the other?

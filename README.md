=============

This repository contains [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code that
summarizes spatial & tabular data to assess Hunter Day Densities by
Wildlife Management Units (WMU). It generates a summary table by WMU and
provincial rasters of Hunter Day Densities.

Hunter Day Densities are summarized from Big Game Harvest Statistics.
The analysis uses the 5 year period 2013 - 2017. It requires FLNRORD
fish and wildlife permission for access.

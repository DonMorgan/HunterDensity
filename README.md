# HunterDensity
Repo to estimate hunter density in BC

This repository contains [R](https://www.r-project.org/) code that summarizes spatial & tabular data to assess hunter density in BC.

## Data
**Hunter Day Density**:
This analysis uses the un-published British Columbia hunter day information

## Usage

There are four core scripts that are required for the Hunter Density analysis, they need to be run in order:

-   01\_load.R
-   02\_clean.R
-   03\_analysis.R
-   04\_output.R

Or you can run all four scripts using run_all.R.

All packages used in the analyses can be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`.
